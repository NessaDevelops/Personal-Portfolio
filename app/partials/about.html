			        	<p class="descrip"> My passion for web design started when I was 10 years old. I would commonly used a website called, 'Neopets' & design user shops & guild websites with HTML/CSS. Ever since then I knew I wanted to be a web designer. As I got older & more interested in technology I thought it would be awesome to also learn how to code. So when looking for a university to study at I found the perfect degree at Neumont University! Now here I am about to graduate (in March!!!) from Neumont with a degree in <b>Web Design & Development</b> & a strong drive to improve my skills.</p>
